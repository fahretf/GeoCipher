# GeoCipher

GeoCipher is a location based encrypted messaging app that lets users drop and retrieve secret messages at real-world GPS coordinates. Messages are locked with a secret key and can only be unlocked by those who visit the exact location and enter a predetermined key.  

## Status
This project is currently in early development. Existing features:
- Continuous location retrieval
- Displaying locations as latitude and longitude on screen


## Tech Stack  
- **Kotlin**  
- **AES-256 Encryption** *(to be implemented)*  
- **GPS-based location tracking**
- **Firebase as a database**

## Setup & Installation  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/fahretf/GeoCipher.git

## Roadmap

Implement GPS location tracking
Add message encryption and decryption
Store messages securely with expiration logic
Improve UI/UX
